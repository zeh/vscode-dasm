# Dasm macro assembler for VSCode

This is a dasm macro assembler [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zehfernando.vscode-dasm). It aims to provide the following in-editor features:

* Powerful assembly source editing for the 6502 (and others) using the [dasm macro assembler](http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/)
* Assembling and exporting generated byte code (ROMs)
* Running Atari VCS 2600 code with full debugging and run-as-you-type abilities

**Notice, however, that this extension is a work-in-progress and that many features do not work yet.** More importantly, it doesn't yet create a separate ROM file nor does it open the emulator preview tab. You would need to rely on the command-line dasm and the Stella emulator (or others) for that.

See more about the motivation for this extension in the [Why Atari?](/client/WHY.md) document.

## Acknowledgements

This extension uses the original [dasm macro assembler](http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/) via [dasmjs](https://github.com/zeh/dasmjs), an [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)-compiled version of the original C code. This is ran on the background, as a language server tracked as [a separate part of this repository](/server/README.md).

It also uses [Javatari](https://github.com/ppeccin/javatari.js) to preview Atari-compatible ROMs.

And finally, this extension was heavily inspired by the [8bitworkshop](http://8bitworkshop.com/?platform=vcs&file=examples%2Fhello) web-based Atari development IDE (but shares no code with it except for its reliance on Javatari). One could say this extension is an attempt to create a similar Atari development experience, but within a dedicated standalone desktop application.
